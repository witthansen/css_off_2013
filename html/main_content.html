<p><h2>Awful immigration laws from around the world</h2>
Italy penalizes illegal immigrants with a fine of €5,000-10,000 and allows immigration officials to detain them for up to 6 months. ● Switzerland immediately deports all convicted criminals from other countries and potentially even their family members. ● Australia detains all non-citizens without a valid visa. ● Japan is allowed to pay $3,000 to each unemployed Latin Americn immigrant of Japanese descent and $2,000 to each of that unemployed worker&#39;s family members to return to their country of origin. ● The United Arab Emirates prohibits foreigners from engaging in any sort of labor union-like activity, resulting in harsh living conditions, 80-hour work weeks, back-breaking manual labor, and below-minimum-wage pay.</p>

On the night of Aug 8, 1975, a line of people frantically piled sandbags atop Henan Province&#39;s Banqiao Dam while being battered by the worst storm ever recorded in the region. They were in a race with the rapidly rising Ru River to save the dam and the millions of people that lay sleeping downstream. It was a race they were about to lose.
Just after 1:00 am, the sky cleared and stars emerged from behind the storm clouds. There was an eerie calm as someone yelled, &quot;The water level is going down! The flood is retreating!&quot;
There was little chance to enjoy that calm. One survivor recalled that a few seconds later it &quot;sounded like the sky was collapsing and the earth was cracking.&quot; The equivalent of 280,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools burst through the crumbling dam, taking with it entire towns and as many as 171,000 lives.</p>
