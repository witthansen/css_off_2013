<h1>Contributing to inuit.css</h1>
<p>So, you want to contribute to inuit.css? That’s awesome!</p>
<p>However, I do ask that you follow a few small rules…</p>
<h2>Bugs and issues</h2>
<p>If you believe you have a bug or issue that needs investigating:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search existing issues to avoid opening a duplicate.</li>
<li>Please open an issue and be as descriptive as possible.</li>
<li>If you can, accompany the report with a reduced test case via
<a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a> or similar.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pull requests</h2>
<p>If submitting a pull request:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow the predefined code style used in the framework (I’m afraid that means
no spaces before opening braces and after colons (I’m weird like that)).</li>
<li>Read my <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2012/12/my-git-workflow-for-inuit-css/">Git workflow for inuit.css</a>
and try and keep as close to that as possible.</li>
<li>Carry out all your work in a topic branch with a suitable name, e.g.
<code>fix/grids</code>, <code>feature/new-object</code> etc.</li>
<li>Commit sensibly and, if needs be, rebase your branch to tidy your commits up.</li>
<li>Ensure inuit.css still compiles without error through both the standalone
library and the web template.</li>
<li>Submit all pull requests against the <code>incoming</code> branch. Any pull requests
submitted against <code>master</code> <strong>will</strong> be declined.</li>
<li>Advise on versioning if possible; if the changes require a version bump or
merely a patch bump, please let me know.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Feature requests</h2>
<p>I am open to requests for adding new features, but please bear in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure it fits in the with ideals and scope of the project; inuit.css has a
very specific purpose and all features need tp tie in with this.</li>
<li>Have a go at adding the new functionality yourself and opening a pull request.</li>
<li><strong>Discuss any features before attempting to develop them yourself;</strong> I would
hate for anyone to spend a tonne of time on something that I end up rejecting.</li>
</ul>
